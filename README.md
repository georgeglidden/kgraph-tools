kgraph-tools
------------------

### Overview
------------------
applets and algorithms for the study of k-graphs and k-graph C\*-algebras

A mutable implementation of k-graph skeletons as colored digraphs is given in `kgraph.py`.

`moves/` contains implementations for the six Morita equivalence-preserving moves on 1-graphs, and more general classes for graph rewriting operations.

`io/` contains rudimentary functions for importing and exporting k-graphs from strings and files.

### To-Do
------------------
search algorithms on families of ME graphs

implementations of ME-preserving moves on higher-rank graphs

automated theorem checking for ME of a set of graphs
